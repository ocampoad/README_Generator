## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Javascript
- NPM:
    - Inquirer
    - Fs
- module.exports
- Moment.js
​

​
### What I learned
​
I learned how to use some of NPM packages. The main ones I used in this challenge are Inquirer and FS. The NPM documentation for each package does vary in detail but they are helpful in figuring out how to use. 

### Continued development
​
There are other packages I tried using that I found out I did not need for this challenge. Some of those package include a fetch() and jquery packages. 
​
### Useful resources
​
- [NPM Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) - Documentation helped me understand how to use this package
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Great resource of other developers helping other developers. They answered specific questions others have encountered. 
- [lukas-h/ license.badges.md](https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba) - Provided lists of license badges to use for README
